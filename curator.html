            <h4>Who am I?</h4>
                <p>I am a self-taught Front-End Web Developer with a passion for creative minimalism and simplicity when it comes to effective Web Design/Development.</p> 
                <p>I am driven by the curiosity of learning, the passion for creating and the desire to master new skills. I sometimes believe that less is more and like to employ this thought in my work.</p>
                <p>Aside from Web Development, I am a visual creative that enjoys creating with my hands, be it beautifully plated food, curated photography content or stylish men’s ensembles.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
            <h4>What did I do before Web Development?</h4> 
                <p>I studied Kinesiology and Health, and Psychology at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, NJ. Kinesiology is the study of human movement (think Anatomy and Physiology).</p>  
                <p>I worked as a Physical Therapy Technician in harmony with Physical Therapists to help provide treatments to 100’s of patients for 10’s of illnesses/injuries.</p>
                <p>In case you missed it, I also enjoy cooking, photography and men’s fashion. Want to know more? Shoot me an Email, let’s grab some coffee together!</p>
